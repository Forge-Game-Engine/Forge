# Game and Scenes

The [game](./game.md) and it's [scenes](./scene.md) are important concepts for organizing and running your project. 

You can think of the game instance as the stage for a play, while the scenes are well... scenes!

You will usually only have a single game instance and then you will swop out different scenes depending on what the player needs to be interacting with at any given time. 

If this sounds a bit abstract right now, don't worry, the next few sections show clear things up.
